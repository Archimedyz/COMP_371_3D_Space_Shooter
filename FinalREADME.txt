3D_SPACE_SHOOTER

Welcome to the outer space Cadet!

In order to run our project you can do 2 things:

1. Go into the Debug folder and run COMP_371_3D_Space_Shooter.exe

2. In the main directory open the Visual Studio 2013 solution file: COMP_371_3D_Space_Shooter.sln and hit f5 to build and run the program yourself.

Libraries required are all already linked dynamically. The libraries used were:

GLM
GLFW
GLEW
FMOD (for sound)


Changes since the presentation:

Added textured skybox
Textured ship
Textured asteroids
Textured space station
Textured projectiles

Asteroids now break off into smaller ones when hit
